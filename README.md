# Graph-Coloring-Problem
Project showcasing my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and the famous graph coloring problem. 

No two adjacent verticies can have the same color, but you want to use as few colors as possible to color it in.

Input should be be in the form <number of colors> <number of verticies> <list of points>

Example: 2 4 (0 1)(1 2)(2 3)(3 0)(-1 -1)

(-1 -1) should always mark the end of your vertex list. 

This project was initially developed for my Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis class. I plan on adding additional functionality, test cases, and a UI to improve my software development skills!
